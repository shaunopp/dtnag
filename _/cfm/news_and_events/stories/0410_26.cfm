<p class="newssubhead_t1">Friday Cash Livestock Prices  </p>
<p>Barrows and gilts in the Iowa/Minnesota direct trade opened 2.53 higher at 81.80 on a carcass basis, the West is 2.99 higher also at 81.80, and the East is down .74 at 76.22. The Missouri direct base carcass meat price is steady from 69.00 to 70.00. Given the aggressive way hog buyers have been pushing since midweek despite slower chain speed and skeletal Saturday kill plans, ready market hog numbers seem to be shrinking at a faster rate than either the March 1 inventory implied or bullish speculators imagined. From Thursday to Thursday the Pork carcass value gained 5.94. Obviously this speaks well for seasonal pork demand.</p>
<p>The cash cattle trade is quiet with most business done for the week. <font style="background-color:#E6EEFF">DTN&rsquo;s John Harrington says, there is some evidence that cattle buyers have put more live inventory on the shelf this week, either by weighing them up or convincing sellers to accept delayed delivery, maybe up to two weeks. </font>Though it is difficult to say how much of this has been done, any level bespeaks of decant confidence in wholesale beef demand and/or ongoing concern about spring supplies. Choice boxed beef at midday is up .14 at 167.10, and select is .53 lower at 164.10.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle receipts at Missouri auctions this week totaled 57,503 head. Compared to last week feeders were steady to 5.00 lower. Feeder steers, medium and large 1 weighing 500 to 600 pounds traded from 106.00 to 141.00, 7 to 8 weights from 93.50 to 122.00. Feeder heifers of the same quality weighing 500 to 600 pounds brought 96.50 to 124.00, 7 to 8 weights from 83.00 to 112.35 per hundredweight.</p>
