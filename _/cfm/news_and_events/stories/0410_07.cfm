<p class="newssubhead_t1">Wheat leads soybeans and corn higher</p>
<p>Soybeans were higher on technical buying, short covering and spillover from wheat. On one hand, contracts are oversold and there wasn&rsquo;t much follow through selling after the lower open. On the other hand, South America&rsquo;s soybeans are generally in good shape and fundamentals continue to turn more bearish. Celeres reports that Brazil&rsquo;s harvest is ahead of the five year average with Mato Grosso nearly wrapped up and Argentina&rsquo;s Ag Ministry increased its production estimate to 55 million tons. Soybean meal and oil were higher on spillover from beans. Oil had additional support from crude oil and meal had extra interest tied to oversold signals. Taiwan&rsquo;s Breakfast Soybean Procurement Association is tendering for 40,000 to 60,000 tons of optional origin soybeans.</p>
<p>Corn was higher on short covering and technical buying, along with spillover from wheat. Also, while weather is mostly a negative, there are concerns about planting delays due to wet conditions in parts of the Midwest but in any event, there&rsquo;s a way to go with this year&rsquo;s crop. Gains were limited by the higher dollar and corn&rsquo;s fundamental bearishness with a large supply and a neutral at best demand outlook. We&rsquo;ll get a better idea of just how bearish those fundamentals are Friday at 7:30 AM Central. Ethanol futures were mixed.</p>
<p>The wheat complex was higher on buy stops, short covering and technical buying, leading the grains and oilseeds higher. Wheat&rsquo;s fundamentals are negative but wheat traders continue to hold the largest net short position of the grains and oilseeds. Winter wheat&rsquo;s in much better than a year ago shape with 65% of the crop in good to excellent condition, compared to 43% this time last year. European wheat was higher on technical buying; May Paris was up .8% and May London was .3% higher. <font style="background-color:#E6EEFF">DTN reported Iraq bought 500,000 tons of wheat (300,000 tons from Russia, 150,000 tons from Canada and the remaining 50,000 tons U.S.).</font> Japan issued a tender for 157,000 tons of wheat (46,000 tons Canadian western red spring, 39,000 tons U.S. dark northern spring, 27,000 tons U.S. western white, 24,000 tons U.S. hard red winter and 21,000 tons Australian standard white).</p>
