<p>In preparation for the June 1, 2010 sign up deadline for the Average Crop Revenue Election Program, NCGA has teamed up with DTN to offer growers a free webinar featuring the most up to date information about the safety net program. The webinar, titled &lsquo;Is ACRE the Right Safety Net for You?&rsquo; will help growers assess how well the program protected crop revenue for 2009 and whether it makes sense for them in 2010-2012.</p>
<p>The webinar is scheduled for Thursday, May 6 at 7:00 a.m. Central, 8:00 a.m. Eastern and will feature Farm Service Agency ACRE expert Brent Orr and Ohio State University economist Carl Zulauf. Pre-registrants will receive handouts in advance.</p>
<p>Registration is available on the NCGA web site &ndash; www dot ncga dot com (www.ncga.com).</p>
