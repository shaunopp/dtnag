Gold for April delivery settled at $1,740.30 an ounce, down 1.1% on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. For the week, gold futures gained 0.5%. &quot;Fundamentally, the market is being hit by the bullish January nonfarm payroll and unemployment numbers,&quot; said Darin Newsom, a senior analyst at Telvent DTN. &quot;Technically, the April contract is sharply overbought according to daily stochastics and due for a setback.&quot; The contract gained nearly $25 an ounce in the last three trading sessions.</p>
