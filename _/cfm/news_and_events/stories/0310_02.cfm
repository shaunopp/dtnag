<p class="newssubhead_t1">Hopes for early spring not panning out</p>
<p>If you were hoping for a dry month of March&mdash;and an early spring&mdash;you are probably going to be disappointed. </p>
<p><font style="background-color:#E6EEFF">DTN meteorologist Bryce Anderson says rain mixed with snow will move across much of the Midwest later into this weekend.  And he is predicting more precipitation, likely in the form of one to three inches of snow in the Western Corn Belt, towards the end of next week. </font></p>
<p><font style="background-color:#E6EEFF">&ldquo;The significance of that is that we&rsquo;re not going to have a real sustained period of drying conditions going on,&rdquo; Anderson says, &ldquo;and it also means, frankly, that the risk of flooding is going to be a big factor, as we have been concerned about for quite a while now.&rdquo; </font></p>
<p><font style="background-color:#E6EEFF">Anderson says the record amounts of snow covering most of the Midwest make a sudden warming trend less likely.</font></p>
