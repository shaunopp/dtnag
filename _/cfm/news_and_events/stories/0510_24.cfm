<p class="newssubhead_t1">Friday cash livestock prices at midday    </p>
Barrows and gilts in the Iowa/Minnesota direct trade are 1.70 lower, the West is down 1.12 with both at 84.31 on a carcass basis, and the East is down .59 at 83.20. The Missouri direct base carcass meat price is steady at 78.00 to 80.00. Carcass value struggled a bit on Thursday, but that fact is offset relatively slow country receipts and short-bought processors. So far packers have exercised good discipline, resisting the temptation to increase the pace of production. Buyers are ending the week short-bought and will probably start next week in the same shape.<br />
The cattle trade appears to be done for the week. While trade volumes look generally decent, aggressive chain speed suggests packers are certainly not guilty of hoarding according to DTN&rsquo;s John Harrington. Harrington says the guess is that buyers will start out short bought again next week, but with some narrower margins. For their part, feedlot managers will probably not hesitate to price new show lists on a firm basis, 102.00 plus in the South, and 165.00 plus in the North.  Choice boxed beef is up .14 at 169.93, and the select is 1.56 lower at 154.60.<br />
Feeder cattle receipts at Missouri auctions this week totaled 26,332 head. Compared to last week feeder steers and heifers and Holstein steers were steady. Demand was moderate to good, and supply was moderate. Feeder steers medium and large 1 averaging 523 pounds traded at 130.38 per hundredweight. 524 heifers in Missouri brought 119.95 on average.
