<p class="newssubhead_t1">Favorable fall forecast for farmers and harvest</p>
<p>Farmers across Nebraska should be pleased with the latest long-range forecast. As the harvest gets underway, a meteorologist with D-T-N says the weather the next couple of months should prove to be very good for agriculture. Bryce Anderson says the harvest began over the past week or two.</p>
<p>Anderson says the crops are so far along in their ripening and maturity rate that farmers will be able to get into the fields and &ldquo;really take care of business&rdquo; much earlier than last year. He predicts &ldquo;harvest is going to go quite well.&rdquo; Anderson says the overall weather picture is looking very favorable for Nebraska farmers.</p>
<p>He says harvest will be starting during the final days of the official summer season and into early fall, so there will be longer daylight hours to work in, which a plus. As for rain, the weather patterns indicate there shouldn&rsquo;t be any major moisture systems setting up and settling in, at least for this section of the Corn Belt.</p>
<p>Anderson says the majority of harvest could be completed by Halloween. He says, &ldquo;Producers are going to be able to get crops out of the field in good shape at a very acceptable level of moisture, so the driers aren&rsquo;t going to have to run nearly as much as they did last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He predicts the harvest should be wrapping up by the end of October, a big change from last year. Heavy rains late in 2009 turned many fields to muddy lakes, making harvest very difficult &mdash; and impossible in some areas. Some farmers had to leave crops over the winter to harvest early this year.</p>
