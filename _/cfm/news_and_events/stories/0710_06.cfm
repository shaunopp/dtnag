<p class="newssubhead_t1">Gold rises 1.2%; silver sees weekly rally</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Gold rose 1.2% Friday as investors found a renewed appetite for the metal after it traded below $1,200 an ounce for three straight sessions.</p>
<p>Gold for August delivery gained $13.70, or 1.2%, to settle at $1,209.80 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, building on narrower gains earlier in the session.</p>
<p>Friday advance made it possible for gold to eke out gains of 0.2% for the week, a welcome change from last week's rout in which prices lost nearly 4%.</p>
<p>Gold has lost 3.8% from its June 18 nominal record of $1,258.30 an ounce.</p>
<p>Silver tracked gold, with the metal for September delivery adding 20 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $18.07 an ounce. Silver gained 5.6% on the week, its biggest five-day period since early April.</p>
<p>The lower prices in recent sessions have attracted buyers interested in parking their money in a safe-haven investment ahead of the weekend, said Darin Newsom, analyst with DTN Telvent in Omaha.</p>
<p>Physical demand for bullion has also provided support, as the weaker prices have sparked interest from jewelry buyers in Asia.</p>
<p>Despite the recent pullbacks, analysts are far from having cooled on gold.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend is still upward,&quot; said Dennis Gartman, an economist and editor of the Gartman Letter in Suffolk, Va. News this week that central banks around the world had sold their gold to the Bank for International Settlements in a swap transaction, mostly viewed as negative, was anything but, Gartman said.</p>
<p>Several market participants worried that some central banks would not be able to make good on the loans, forcing the BIS to sell the gold in the open market.</p>
<p>But the transaction, which allowed the central banks to raise cash with an option to repurchase gold later, showed gold taking a role of a currency worth reserving, supplanting the euro, Gartman said.</p>
<p>And, in a research report Friday, Deutsche Bank said concerns about gold being overbought would only be justified if prices rose about $1,400 an ounce.</p>
<p>Despite the June 18 nominal record, gold's performance &quot;still lags the gains of other commodities such as crude oil and copper at the peak of their cycles,&quot; analysts at Deutsche Bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe gold prices will continue to benefit from strong investment demand from both private and public sectors. We expect a resumption in U.S. dollar weakness and the possibility of regulatory action will be the catalyst for even higher gold prices going forward,&quot; they told clients.</p>
<p>Earlier Friday, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said that he saw stronger economic activity in the euro-zone region but that &quot;it is still too early to declare the crisis over.&quot;</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, European equities moved higher, and U.S. stocks managed to keep narrow gains. Read more about stocks.</p>
<p>Other metals tracked gold and silver higher. September copper rose 4 cents, or 1.3%, to $3.05 a pound</p>
<p>The copper market &quot;has been extraordinarily resilient&quot; in recent months despite &quot;a deteriorating outlook for global growth and heightened risk aversion by investors,&quot; the analysts at Deutsche Bank said.</p>
<p>Copper continues to face some downward pressure, but prices are supported by still-strong Chinese buying, among other factors, they said.</p>
<p>September palladium advanced $12.55, or 2.8%, to settle at $456.95 an ounce.</p>
<p>October platinum, the most active contract, gained $16.80, or 1.1%, to $1,533.20 an ounce.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, holdings at SPDR Gold Trust , the largest exchange-traded fund backed by gold, have declined for the second consecutive day.</p>
<p>The ETF holdings declined to 1,316.03 metric tons (1,450.67 short tons) on Thursday, the last day for which figures are available, from 1,316.48 metric tons the day before. Holdings hit a record of 1,320.43 metric tons on June 30.</p>
