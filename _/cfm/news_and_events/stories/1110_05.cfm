<p class="newssubhead_t1">Wheat unable to hold gains</p>
Some noncommercial buying late in the session pushed the soybean market to close modestly higher. Shortly after the close, the Fed announced it would buy $600 billion in U.S. Treasury Bonds over the next 8 months and would likewise keep interest rates low for an extended period. That should put pressure on the dollar and provide support to commodities. DTN says the commercial soybean outlook is less bullish because of improved weather for Brazil and the recent cool down in demand.<br />
Corn looked as if it might turn lower early in the session, but recovered on renewed buying interest from both sides of the market to close with solid gains. With the anticipated weakening of the dollar, corn may strengthen further. Traders are waiting for USDA&rsquo;s expected cut in production next Tuesday, while export demand continues to lag.<br />
For a fourth straight session, a lack of buying interest resulted in wheat not being able to hold early gains. Even though there&rsquo;s talk of dwindling global wheat supplies because of dry weather in the Black Sea region and the Southern Plains, there are indications that the commercial outlook is growing more bearish. There&rsquo;s hope, however, that the weak dollar will allow exports to pick up.
