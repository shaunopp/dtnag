<p class="newssubhead_t1">First ag competition workshop is in Iowa</p>
<p>The first Department of Justice/USDA workshop on competition in agriculture takes place in Ankeny, Iowa Friday.</p>
<p>Agricultural competition is one of those &ldquo;hot button&rdquo; topics, one that evokes some very strong emotions.  Corning, Iowa farmer Ray Gaesser, vice-president of the American Soybean Association will be part of a workshop panel discussing seed competition issues.  He says there&rsquo;s fine line between too much and too little regulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think there is a need to review what&rsquo;s going on in our industry&mdash;but at the same time, we have concerns that we go too far and stifle innovation,&rdquo; Gaesser says, &ldquo;so it&rsquo;s really a fine line that we must walk on to make sure that we have competition, but at the same time that we don&rsquo;t over-control and stifle competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How great is the interest in this subject?  <font style="background-color:#E6EEFF">DTN reports that, prior to the workshops, Justice and USDA asked for public comments and received more than 15-thousand responses&mdash;so many that DOJ has been unable to post all of them.</font></p>
