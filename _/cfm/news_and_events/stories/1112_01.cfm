<p>Feast or famine, literally, I am David Sparks with the Ag Information Network and I want you to hear what meteorologist Bryce Anderson recently told me about regarding the 2012 drought. The circumstances that much of the country finds itself in now and then looking ahead to winter are really quite extensively on the dry side. When you look at the US as judged by the drought Monitor you are looking at drought over 90% of the US. Now can I remind you of the recent tragedy produced by hurricane Sandy. As the United States picks up the pieces after hurricane Sandy&rsquo;s wrath, there is a growing concern about the long-term effects on some of the nations largest food crops. The hurricane swept up the east coast but prior to that through the southern hemispheres Caribbean islands In full force bringing viciously strong winds and rainfall that destroyed homes, crops and many lives. Sandy destroyed banana crops in eastern Jamaica As well as decimating the coffee crop in Cuba. It is premature to judge the net effect of this perfect storm on US crop production but it is safe to say that there will be noticeable shortages between our own consumption and sending food to so many countries in the southern hemisphere. So is it feast or famine? Sink or swim? Only time can tell.</p>
