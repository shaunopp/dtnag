<p class="newssubhead_t1">PULSE: Oil inches up, logs weekly decline of over 4%</p>
<p>Oil futures settled with a slight gain Friday, but suffered a decline of more than 4% for the week as recent economic data in the U.S. and elsewhere did little to spur demand prospects. December crude rose 23 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $86.28 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. U.S. economic data Friday &quot;seemed to be viewed as bullish, allowing crude oil to turn a small loss into a modest gain,&quot; said Darin Newsom, senior analyst at Telvent DTN. &quot;Longer term though, ample supplies are expected to hold potential rallies in check.&quot;</p>
