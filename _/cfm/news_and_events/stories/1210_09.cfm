<p class="newssubhead_t1">After a higher start, grains and oilseeds finish mostly lower</p>
<p>Soybeans ended the session mixed, mostly firm on consolidation and a lack of follow through buying in most months. South American weather remains mixed, favoring Brazil over Argentina. That said – fundamentals remain strong with China buying 110,000 tons of U.S. soybeans for delivery during the 2011/12 marketing year. In any event, South American weather, overall demand and the impact on global supply will continue to be the big issues moving forward. Soybean meal was up on the solid recent export demand along with cold weather around the Midwest; according to DTN South Korean feed concerns picked up 170,000 tons of Soybean meal. Soybean oil was lower on profit taking. USDA’s weekly export sales report is out Thursday at 7:30 AM Central. Soybeans are pegged at 600,000 to 900,000 tons, meal is seen at 125,000 to 250,000 tons and oil is placed at 20,000 to 100,000 tons.</p>
<p>Corn was lower on profit taking and a lack of follow-through buying. Also, corn was a little overbought on a technical basis, fundamentals are neutral at best and there was just no real fresh news. Contracts made another round of new one month highs prior to pulling back. The drier than normal conditions in critical portions of Argentina did limit losses; Argentina’s the world’s second leading producer of corn, behind the U.S. Ethanol futures were higher on supportive ethanol demand outlooks. Weekly U.S. corn exports are estimated at 600,000 to 1.1 million tons.</p>
<p>The wheat complex was mixed. Chicago was up on technical buying and short covering while KC and Minneapolis were lower on profit taking. There’s some precipitation in the forecast for the Southern Plains, but it’s expected to be pretty light and scattered, and China remains cold. Australian conditions have turned drier allowing for harvest and Russian temperatures are more seasonal. Egypt bought 110,000 tons of U.S. hard red winter and 120,000 tons of wheat from France. European wheat was higher on the Egyptian purchase. Turkey announced it will make 610,000 tons of milling wheat available for export. Weekly U.S. wheat sales are seen at 400,000 to 700,000 tons.</p>
