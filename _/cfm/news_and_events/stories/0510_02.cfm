SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- The oil spill has not yet disrupted shipping lanes in the Gulf, although the situation could worsen. <font style="background-color:#E6EEFF">Grains from the Midwest and other points in the U.S. are exported through the ports of New Orleans and Houston, with soybeans shipments slowing down this time of the year and corn shipments starting to pick up, particularly through New Orleans, said Darin Newsom, a senior commodities analyst at Telvent DTN in Omaha.</font> But the spill &quot;is not having a huge effect right now,&quot; he said. Corn for July delivery, the most active contract, rose 4 cents, or 1%, to $3.73 a bushel on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Soybeans for July delivery, also the most active, added a penny, or 0.1%, to $9.97 a bushel on Comex.
