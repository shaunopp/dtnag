<p class="newssubhead_t1">Soaring wheat prices lead most commodities higher</p>
<p>Soaring wheat prices led most commodities higher Wednesday. The drivers were upbeat global economic news and expectations that help may be on the way for Europe's financial problems.</p>
<p>Wheat jumped 7.2 percent on the first day of December. Gasoline rose 5 percent. Oil, corn and many industrial metals also posted hefty gains.</p>
<p>Traders grew more optimistic after reports showed manufacturing activity increased in the United States and China.</p>
<p>At the same time, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet suggested that the bank could buy bonds issued by countries within the European Union. Also, Portugal completed a better-than-expected bond auction.</p>
<p>The dollar grew weaker against other currencies. Since commodities are priced in dollars, a weaker dollar makes them more of a bargain for buyers using other currencies.</p>
<p>Wheat prices have been inching up recently after rainy weather in Australia prompted questions about the quality of the crop, but no new developments surfaced Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It just seems to be these outside influences, along with some of the old issues that still are alive and well in these markets, that are pushing us higher,&quot; Telvent DTN analyst Darin Newsom said.</p>
<p>Wheat for March delivery added 49.5 cents to settle at $7.40 a bushel. March corn gained 22.25 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $5.6625 a bushel and January soybeans gained 40 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $12.43 a bushel.</p>
<p>Industrial metals such as copper, platinum and palladium benefited from the manufacturing reports.</p>
<p>The Institute of Supply Management said U.S. factory output grew in November on stronger demand for automobiles, computers and other goods.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the state-affiliated China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said its purchasing managers index rose to 55.2 last month from 54.7 in October.</p>
<p>However, the survey noted that rising prices for products and materials used in manufacturing remain a concern after inflation hit a 25-month high in October.</p>
<p>China, a huge importer of oil and other commodities, has taken steps recently to keep a lid on rising prices and curb growth, which has affected oil prices.</p>
<p>The manufacturing activity &quot;makes it more likely that China will tighten its lending policies, but we knew those measures were likely to be coming soon,&quot; Cameron Hanover energy consultancy said in a research note.</p>
<p>Among the industrial metals, March copper added 12.2 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $3.9475 a pound; December palladium rose $29.80, or 4.3 percent, to settle at $730.75 an ounce and January platinum gained $17.60 to settle at $1,684 an ounce.</p>
<p>In other metals trading, gold for February delivery rose $2.20 settle at $1,388.30 an ounce and March silver added 20.1 cents to settle at $28.413 an ounce.</p>
<p>All energy products settled higher on the day.</p>
<p>Benchmark oil for January delivery settled up $2.64 at $86.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>In other January Nymex contracts, gasoline jumped 5.2 percent, adding 11.36 cents to $2.3004 a gallon, heating oil gained 8.12 cents to settle at $2.4056 a gallon and natural gas rose 8.9 cents to settle at $4.269 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p>
