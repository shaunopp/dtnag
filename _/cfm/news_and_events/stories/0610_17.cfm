<p class="newssubhead_t1">Deferred soybeans rally while corn, wheat fall</p>
Soybeans were mostly higher Monday. The two nearby months were weaker, but deferred contracts finished higher because of concerns over planting delays and an anticipated decline in soybean crop conditions, according to DTN. Meanwhile, old-crop soybeans were pressured by bearish export inspections. Weekly inspections were below both expectations and what is needed to stay on pace with USDA projections. There was also support from tight soybean and soybean meal supplies, but gains were limited because of spillover pressure from corn and wheat. <br />
Corn followed through on last week&rsquo;s sell-off by closing below the support level in both the July and December contracts. As a result, DTN says the long-term trend appears to have turned lower. Good crop weather through the balance of this week combined with bearish export inspections Monday morning brought additional pressure. Traders are focused on potential record-setting yields and a jump in corn acreage when USDA releases their Planted Acreage report Wednesday morning. <br />
In spite of a late rally, winter wheat contracts finished lower on a lack of buying interest. Wheat still endures a negative technical picture near-term, according to DTN. Wheat was also under pressure in both Minneapolis and Chicago due to abundant global supplies and a poor export inspections. Harvest pressure from the Plains will limit buying the balance of the week.
