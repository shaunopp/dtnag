<p class="newssubhead_t1">USDA report forecasts planting intentions for key commodities</p>
<p>The Michigan Field Office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has issued reports that forecast planting intentions for a number of agricultural commodities.<br />
  One is the Michigan Prospective Plantings Report, which provides a state outlook for corn, soybeans, wheat, sugar beets, dry beans, oats, barley and hay.<br />
  According to the Michigan Farm Bureau Agrinotes and News, at which the forecasts can be accessed, <br />
  state farmers intend to plant 700,000 acres of wheat, up 170,000 acres or 32 percent from 2010, while they plan to cut back on dry beans and plant 180,000 acres, down 56,000 acres or 24 percent from 2010.<br />
  The complete story appears in the Tuesday, April 26, 2011 edition and is available at coldwaterdailyreporter.mi.newsmemory.com.</p>
<p>And then there’s the weather<br />
  Bryce Anderson, DTN Senior Ag Meteorologist, said this year’s weather outlook could very well mean a case of “haves and have nots” for farmers across the United States making preparations for the spring planting season. He said the interplay between two major meteorological factors — a historic La Niña cool temperature and prevailing west-to-east trade wind pattern going on out in the Pacific — will determine just how favorable conditions are for producers throughout the country.</p>
