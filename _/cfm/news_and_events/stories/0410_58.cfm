<p class="newssubhead_t1">Monday cash livestock markets    </p>
<p>Barrows and gilts in the Iowa/Minnesota direct trade are 1.05 higher at 81.41 on a carcass basis; the West is up 1.03 at 81.35, and the East is .55 lower at 80.61. Missouri direct base carcass meat price is steady to 3.00 higher at 76.00 to 77.00. Although last week&rsquo;s hog kill was two-percent larger than the previous week, it still fell as much as three-percent below 2009. The spring slaughter continues to suggest that the March 1 inventory over counted market hogs for the second quarter.</p>
<p><font style="background-color:#E6EEFF">DTN&rsquo;s John Harrington says, feedlot managers have several reasons to feel optimistic about cash cattle prospects.</font> Early psychology should get an extra shot in the arm from Friday&rsquo;s confirmation of smaller than expected March placement activity.  Higher cutouts late last week underscored positive packer margins and healthy seasonal product demand. Finally, last week&rsquo;s larger kill certainly worked to safeguard country currentness and promote feedlot leverage. Early ideas of asking prices are around 101.00 to 102.00 in the South and 163.00 plus in the North. Boxed beef cutout values are higher at midday. Choice beef is up 1.38 at 170.34, and select is up .64 at 166.36.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle receipts at Joplin Missouri totaled 4500 today. Compared to last week steer and heifer calves less than 450 pounds opened 2.00 to 3.00 higher, over 450 pounds sold steady. Yearlings were not tested early. Demand for feeders was moderate and the supply is moderate to light. Feeder steers medium and large 1 weighting 500 to 600 pounds brought 122.00 to 127.00. 5 to 6 weight heifers traded from 108 to 114.50 at Joplin.</p>
