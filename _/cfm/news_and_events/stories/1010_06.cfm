<p class="newssubhead_t1">Attack of the cloned 4-H blue ribbon winners</p>
<p>It has the feel of a science fiction story from the &quot;golden age&quot; of the 1950s, perhaps written by Ray Bradbury or Clifford Simak. A fresh-faced farm boy brings his prize steer &quot;Doc&quot; to the Iowa State Fair, and wins the 4-H Grand Champion blue ribbon. Only after the steer triumphs is it revealed that &quot;Doc&quot; is actually a clone of the steer that won the same prize two years earlier. Hardly seems fair, does it?</p>
<p>It's just the kind of twist the masters of science fiction gloried in -- a scene as comfortable and familiar and apple-pie-American as a state fair, warped suddenly into the Twilight Zone with one deft flick. But this story isn't science fiction. It took place three weeks ago at the real Iowa State Fair. 17-year-old Tyler Faber, reports the Des Moines Register, son of David Faber, president of Trans Ova Genetics of Sioux Center, Iowa, took home the prize for &quot;Doc,&quot; two years after winning exactly the same prize for &quot;Wade.&quot; Doc is a clone of Wade. (Hat tip: Barry Estabrook's Politics of the Plate blog.)</p>
<p>There has been a fair bit of chatter in cattle country about whether it is ethical to enter show cattle contests with clones of previous victors, not to mention whether it is just plain discriminatory on financial grounds -- it costs $20-25,000 to clone a cow today. But that's kind of missing the point. There are no rules against cloned 4-H competitors, just as there is no law, in the United States, against selling cloned meat for human consumption. However, there is enough culture-wide ickiness associated with the idea of cloned meat that the FDA has requested that the livestock industry voluntarily keep cloned meat out of the food supply. And some of the largest meat vendors in the U.S. including Tyson Foods and Smithfield Foods, have declared that they will not accept cloned animals.</p>
