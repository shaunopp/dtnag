<p>The annual Crop Outlook and International Durum Forum will be held on Tuesday, Nov. 12 in Minot at the Holiday Inn. The program is a cooperative effort of the North Dakota Wheat Commission and U.S. Durum Growers Association and is designed to provide producers with valuable information on production research, demand trends and supply competition to help guide them in their marketing decisions with the current crop and planting options in 2014. It also provides a great opportunity for producers to visit with industry representatives and other end-users who will be in attendance to get the latest information on the overall quality and availability of the 2013 crop. The meeting will begin at 8:00 a.m. and conclude by late afternoon.</p>

NDSU Research and Extension staff will discuss commodity outlook for 2014 and production topics related to the 2013 wheat crops and recommendations for 2014. Area elevator managers will discuss the marketability of this year&rsquo;s wheat crop and what challenges and opportunities they foresee in the coming months. North Dakota Wheat Commission staff will highlight the quality and supply situation for this year&rsquo;s crop.</p>
<p>Al Gustin, author and retired farm news broadcaster, will be the luncheon speaker. The afternoon portion of the program, sponsored by the U.S. Durum Growers Association (USDGA), will feature Cliff Jamieson with DTN who will discuss marketing strategies and commodity dynamics and Aaron Krauter with ND Farm Service Agency who will discuss prevent plant topics.
