While down from December&rsquo;s index of 109.1 &ndash; the index still reflects an overall positive outlook at 106.9. The composite Agriculture Confidence Index accounts for how farmers feel about their present and future situations. A value of 100 is considered neutral. Higher values indicate optimism and values lower than 100 indicate pessimism. When split into different time frames &ndash; the assessment of the present situation came in at 135.3 &ndash; a strong positive reading. But the expectations farmers have for the year ahead came in at 88.2 &ndash; a firmly negative perspective.</p>
<p>The view from agribusiness owners is better than it was after last year&rsquo;s grain harvest. The overall index value increased from 100.7 to 104.3. Their assessment of the present situation dropped to 112.7 &ndash; while their expectations for the future gained 8.4-points &ndash; reaching 98.5. The agribusiness composite index is 93.3. While providing a better outlook than after harvest &ndash; agribusinesses still aren&rsquo;t as optimistic as they were one year ago. The Agribusiness Index was 111.1 last year &ndash; and expectations for the year ahead were 10 points higher than they are now.</p>
<p>To get the Agriculture Confidence Index &ndash; 500 farmers and ranchers across the country were surveyed between March 1st and March 11th.
