<p class="newssubhead_t1">Alfalfa problems could affect dairy hay supplies</p>
Weather-related damage to Midwest alfalfa fields has affected both the quality and quantity of first-cutting hay&mdash;which some industry analysts say could put a serious dent in supplies of dairy quality hay for the coming winter.<br />
University of Nebraska forage specialist Bruce Anderson tells DTN that, while the weather related losses may not put a huge dent in the overall alfalfa supply, they could greatly decrease supplies of dairy quality hay.  For example, alfalfa grower Andy Stock of Murdock, Nebraska reports that, of his 400 acres of alfalfa, he still has about 100 acres of first-cutting alfalfa in fields that are either too muddy to enter or lying in windrows too moist to bale.  Some of Stock&rsquo;s alfalfa has lain in the field for two weeks.  And he says the alfalfa plants lying underneath the windrows could be suffering damage from being smothered, which could affect the second cutting of alfalfa as well.
