<p class="newssubhead_t1">Goldman's commodity calls trumps Glencore disclosure</p>
<p>Glencore International AG, the secretive Swiss commodities trading firm, announced Thursday that it&rsquo;s planning an $11 billion initial public offering. And, according to a story in the Financial Times, the secretive Swiss commodities giant also disclosed that it controls more than half of the so-called third party market for a handful of base metals — 45% of the third-party lead market, 38% in alumina and between 30% and 20% for aluminum, cobalt and thermal coal, according to FT.</p>
<p>But for the commodities market, those ownership details pale in comparison to a recommendation by Goldman Sachs analysts earlier this week that traders close their long position in the CCCP, or a trading basket of crude oil, copper, cotton, soybeans and platinum. After all, Glencore has &ldquo;always been a physical commodity trading powerhouse,&rdquo; said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics.</p>
<p>Goldman&rsquo;s call &ldquo;has put pressure off and on throughout the week on different commodity sectors,&rdquo; said Darin Newsom, a senior analyst at Telvent DTN. Ahead of the Glencore news, many of the commodities markets were &ldquo;on edge anyway&rdquo; because of the Goldman call.</p>
<p>As for Glencore&rsquo;s disclosure, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it will have an immediate effect unless it is disclosed that the company is unloading some of its commodity holdings,&rdquo; Newsom said. –- Myra P. Saefong</p>
