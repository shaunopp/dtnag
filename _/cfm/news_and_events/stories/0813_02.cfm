<p class="newssubhead_t1">Corn Falls to Lowest Since 2010 on U.S. Record Outlook</p>
<p>Corn extended a decline to a 34-month low as cool weather and moist soil increase yield prospects in the U.S., the world&rsquo;s biggest grower and exporter. Wheat and soybeans fell.</p>
<p>Near-to-below-normal temperatures in the Midwest in the first half of August will favor corn pollination, while moisture will stay favorable in southern and eastern areas, DTN wrote in a forecast today. Farmers may harvest a record 13.95 billion bushels, 29 percent more than last year, when drought hurt crops, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have another week of cool temperatures ahead, and some rains are going to hit the Corn Belt now through Wednesday,&rdquo; Rich Nelson, the chief strategist at Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Illinois, said by telephone. &ldquo;We do want some warmth to show up, maybe starting in late August or September, but that&rsquo;s taking a back seat to this cool weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corn futures for December delivery fell 1 percent to $4.5925 a bushel at 10:22 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, after touching $4.56, the lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 4, 2010. The grain retreated 6.3 percent in July, the sixth straight drop and the worst run since 1996.</p>
<p>Production will top the USDA&rsquo;s forecast, rising to 14.269 billion bushels in 2013, researcher Doane Advisory Services Co. in St. Louis said Aug. 2. Doane&rsquo;s August corn estimate last year was among the most-accurate.</p>
<p>Wheat futures for September delivery declined 2.2 percent to $6.4575 a bushel on the CBOT. The price earlier touched $6.4325, the lowest since June 18, 2012, on speculation that livestock producers will switch back to corn in animal rations as the price spread between the grains widens.</p>
<p>High Premium</p>
<p>Wheat on Aug. 2 was $1.9675 a bushel more expensive than corn futures, the most since February 2011.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheat doesn&rsquo;t work into the blending&rdquo; for animal feed because its premium to corn is too high, Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global Commodity Analytics in Lafayette, Indiana, said by telephone. &ldquo;That wheat-corn spread will shut off the spigot of wheat feeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soybean futures for November delivery slipped 0.1 percent to $11.80 a bushel in Chicago. The price through Aug. 2 was down 16 percent this year.</p>
