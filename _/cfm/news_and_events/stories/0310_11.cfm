<p><font style="background-color:#E6EEFF">The USDA's supply and demand report has put additional pressure on the wheat market. Senior Analyst Darin Newsom notes wheat ending stocks came in at over a billion bushels.</font></p>
<p>&quot;This is like a judge giving someone a sentence of life plus one year.&quot; He says this number really sets a bearish tone as we head into the new growing season.</p>
<p>Carryover estimates were bumped up from 195.9 million metric tonnes to 196.8. Large stocks will provide a buffer, so prices may not rise even if 2010 production is affected by poor weather.</p>
<p>Overall, he says the report was bearish for wheat, corn and soybeans. </p>
